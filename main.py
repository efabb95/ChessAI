""" PRINCIPLES (from protocol docs http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html )

- Communication between GUI and engine happens via standard input/iutput with text commands
- The engine boot should be as fast as possible, wait for either 'isready' or 'setoption' to set internal parameters
- Engine must always be able to process input on stdin, even while pondering
- All command strings exchanged end with '\n'
- Engine is always in 'forced' mode, i.e. it should never start calculating or pondering without receiving a "go" command first.
- Before the engine is asked to search on a position, there will always be a position command to tell the engine about the current position.
- By default, opening books are dealt with by the GUI, unless the 'OwnBook' option is used
- If the engine or GUI receives an unknown command it should just ignore it and parse the rest of the string
- If the engine receives commands at the wrong moment (e.g. 'stop' while it is not calculating) it should just ignore them
- move format is in long agebraic notation, examples:
    e2e4
    e1g1    (white short castling)
    a7a8q   (promotion)
