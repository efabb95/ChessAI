While searching the tree:

check for presence in the table by hashing
if not present...?
if present, check hashentry.depth. if hashentry.depth >= plies left to search
    then use attached values.
    look at flag (HASH_EXACT, HASH_BETA, HASH_ALPHA), respectively:
    - the evaluated move was the best one ( Applied if eval is beta < eval < alpha)
    - the evaluated move was discarded because it was 'too good', the search was cut off. Pos evaluation was at least beta, maybe higher
    - The evaluated move had score lower than alpha
    return alpha = hashentry.score, move = hashentry.move
else just pick the saved next move and start looking from there
